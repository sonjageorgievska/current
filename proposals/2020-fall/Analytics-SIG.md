# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?
Analytics

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?
<!--  Please make sure to have two SIG leads to reduce bus factor.
      SIG leads are allowed to write the hours dedicated to organizing
      SIG activities under the R&D budget. Please mention in the notes the
      name of your SIG:
        Account: 000104
        Project: 020203
        Hour type: 00071

## What is SIG’s mission?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The mission of this SIG in the broadest sense, is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center, as well as their technical implementations. We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.


## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?

## SIG outcomes in the period April 2020 - October 2020 (for existing SIGs)
On May 14th we had a meeting were discussed the outcomes of the survey among the Analytics SIG members. 

We had the following presentations:
- May 11: Johan Hidding - "Complex Systems"
- May 25th: Hanno Spreeuw - "Confidence intervals"
- June 8th: Dafne van Kuppevelt - "Overview of network science"
- June 22nd: Wanda de Keersmaecker - "Time series analysis and change detection techniques - Towards tropical forest resilience from remote sensing time series."
- Okt 12th: Pablo Rodriguez Sanchez - "Complex numbers for research software enginees"
The presentations can be found on the [SIG repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG).

In the remaining sessions, we worked through chapter 2.6 in the book [A first course in network science](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-first-course-in-network-science/EE22722F27519D8BB1443C7225C57BAF). The chapters were read during self-study, and the answers to the exercises were collected through a survey form and discussed during the meeting.

## Plans for the period until the end of April 2021

- **Network Science course**: We continue working on the book [A first course in network science](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/a-first-course-in-network-science/EE22722F27519D8BB1443C7225C57BAF)
- **Monthly presentations**: Continuing the monthly meetings with 30min presentations. We aim for monthly interactive meetings where diverse speakers from in and outside the center present a topic. The topic can be either an introduction into a technique or an application where advanced analytical methods played a pivotal role. The planned/upcoming meetings will be posted on the [Analytics SIG github page](https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG).
- **Organize small hackaton** We choose a dataset and technique that we want to explore and organize a small (1 day?) hackaton around this

Some of the topics we want to explore are:
- Network Science
- Data cleaning for AI, e.g. filling missing values
- Numerical computational techniques

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?
- Internal training on a specific topic (mentioned above)
- Sharing knowledge on statistics (at basic/intermediate level)
- Transfer of knowledge by inviting external speakers
- Keeping a portfolio of expertise in analytics at the center
- Making a collection of tools and resources
